<h2 id="python-installation">Python Installation</h2>

href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">Python 3.6.1 (or later)
executable file from Python.org</a> and run it on your computer.</p>
<div class="important">

</div>
<h2 id="sdk-installation">SDK Installation</h2>

</div>
<p>If you encounter an error during SDK installation, you may need to
upgrade your pip install. Try
<code>python -m pip install --upgrade pip</code> or
<code>py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</code></p>
</div>

</div>
<p>If you encounter an error during SDK installation, you may need to
upgrade your Python Setuptools. Try
<code>py -3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools</code></p>
</div>
<h3 id="sdk-upgrade">SDK Upgrade</h3>
<p>To upgrade the SDK from a previous install, enter this command:</p>
<pre><code>py -3 -m pip install --user --upgrade anki_vector</code></pre>
<h2 id="vector-authentication">Vector Authentication</h2>
<p>To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Command
Prompt window. Note that during this configure step, your password will
not show by design as a security precaution:</p>
<pre><code>py -m anki_vector.configure</code></pre>
<p>You will be prompted for your robot's name, ip address and serial
number. You will also be asked for your Anki login and password. Make
sure to use the same account that was used to set up your Vector.</p>
<p>You will see "SUCCESS!" when this script successfully completes.</p>
<div class="note">
<div class="title">
<p>Note</p>
</div>
<p>By running the <code>anki_vector.configure</code> executable
submodule, you will be asked to provide your Anki account credentials,
and the script will automatically download an authentication token and
certificate to your computer that will grant you access to the robot and
his capabilities (such as camera and audio) as well as data stored on
the robot (such as faces and photos).</p>
<p>The downloaded access token is equivalent to your account
credentials. It will be stored in your user directory (~/.anki_vector)
along with a robot identity certificate and other useful data for
establishing a connection. Do not share your access token.</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<div class="title">
<p>Warning</p>
</div>
<p>These credentials give full access to your robot, including camera
stream, audio stream and data. Do not share these credentials.</p>
</div>
