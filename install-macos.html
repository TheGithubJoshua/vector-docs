<h1 id="install-macos">Installation - macOS / OS X</h1>
<p>This guide provides instructions on installing the Vector SDK for
computers running with a macOS operating system.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vector is powered on.</li>
<li>You have successfully created an Anki account.</li>
<li>Vector has been set up with the Vector companion app.</li>
<li>The Vector companion app is <em>not</em> currently connected to
Vector.</li>
<li>Vector is connected to the same network as your computer.</li>
<li>You can see Vector's eyes on his screen.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="python-installation">Python Installation</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Install <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> on your system
according to the latest instructions. If you already had brew installed
then update it by opening a Terminal window and typing in the
following:</p>
<pre><code>brew update</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Once Homebrew is installed and updated, type the following into
the Terminal window to install the latest version of Python 3:</p>
<pre><code>brew install python3</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>The Vector SDK supports Python 3.6.1 or later.</p>
<h2 id="sdk-installation">SDK Installation</h2>
<p>To install the SDK, type the following into the Terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install --user anki_vector</code></pre>
<h3 id="sdk-upgrade">SDK Upgrade</h3>
<p>To upgrade the SDK from a previous install, enter this command:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade anki_vector</code></pre>
<h2 id="vector-authentication">Vector Authentication</h2>
<p>To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Terminal
window. Note that during this configure step, your password will not
show by design as a security precaution:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m anki_vector.configure</code></pre>
<p>You will be prompted for your robot's name, ip address and serial
number. You will also be asked for your Anki login and password. Make
sure to use the same account that was used to set up your Vector.</p>
<p>You will see "SUCCESS!" when this script successfully completes.</p>
<div class="note">
<div class="title">
<p>Note</p>
</div>
<p>By running the <code>anki_vector.configure</code> executable
submodule, you will be asked to provide your Anki account credentials,
and the script will automatically download an authentication token and
certificate to your computer that will grant you access to the robot and
his capabilities (such as camera and audio) as well as data stored on
the robot (such as faces and photos).</p>
<p>The downloaded access token is equivalent to your account
credentials. It will be stored in your user directory (~/.anki_vector)
along with a robot identity certificate and other useful data for
establishing a connection. Do not share your access token.</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">
<div class="title">
<p>Warning</p>
</div>
<p>These credentials give full access to your robot, including camera
stream, audio stream and data. Do not share these credentials.</p>
