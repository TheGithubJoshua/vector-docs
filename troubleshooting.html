<h2 id="failure-to-install-python-package">Failure to Install Python
Package</h2>
<p>If you run into trouble installing Python packages, please upgrade
your pip install as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On macOS and Linux:</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install -U pip</code></pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre><code>python -m pip install --upgrade pip</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively on Windows, try:</p>
<pre><code>py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip</code></pre>
<p>You may also need to update Python setuptools (for instance, for
error
<code>AttributeError: '_NamespacePath' object has no attribute 'sort'</code>):</p>
<pre><code>pip install --upgrade setuptools</code></pre>
<p>After applying these updates, retry your Python package
installation.</p>

<p>Before running a Python program, be sure you can see Vector's eyes.
If instead you see an image of a mobile device, the Customer Care Info
screen, a missing Wifi icon, or something else, please complete setup of
your Vector first and then you will be ready set up the SDK.</p>
<p>Also, check whether Vector's IP address has changed since the last
time you ran <code>anki_vector.configure</code>. If so, see <code
class="interpreted-text" role="ref">moving_between_wifi</code> to set up
the robot with the new IP address.</p>
