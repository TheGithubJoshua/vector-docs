<ul>
<li>Vector is powered on.</li>
<li>You have successfully created an Anki account.</li>
<li>Vector has been set up with the Vector companion app.</li>

<p>Warning</p>
</div>
<p>The Vector SDK is tested and and supported on Ubuntu 18.04 and 16.04.
Anki makes no guarantee the Vector SDK will work on other versions of
Linux. If you wish to try the Vector SDK on versions of Linux <em>other
than</em> Ubuntu 18.04 or 16.04, please ensure the following
dependencies are installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6.1 or later</li>
<li>pip for Python 3 (Python package installer)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-installation">Python Installation</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Type the following into your Terminal window to install
Python:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then install pip by typing in the following into the Terminal
window:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python3-pip</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Last, install Tkinter:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sdk-installation">SDK Installation</h3>
<p>To install the SDK, type the following into the Terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install --user anki_vector</code></pre>
<h3 id="sdk-upgrade">SDK Upgrade</h3>
<p>To upgrade the SDK from a previous install, enter this command:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade anki_vector</code></pre>
<h2 id="vector-authentication">Vector Authentication</h2>
<p>To authenticate with the robot, type the following into the Terminal
window. Note that during this configure step, your password will not
show by design as a security precaution:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m anki_vector.configure</code></pre>
<p>You will be prompted for your robot's name, ip address and serial
number. You will also be asked for your Anki login and password. Make
sure to use the same account that was used to set up your Vector.</p>
<p>You will see "SUCCESS!" when this script successfully completes.</p>
<div class="note">
<div class="title">
<p>Note</p>
</div>
<p>By running the <code>anki_vector.configure</code> executable
submodule, you will be asked to provide your Anki account credentials,
and the script will automatically download an authentication token and
certificate to your computer that will grant you access to the robot and
his capabilities (such as camera and audio) as well as data stored on
the robot (such as faces and photos).</p>
<p>The downloaded access token is equivalent to your account
credentials. It will be stored in your user directory (~/.anki_vector)
along with a robot identity certificate and other useful data for
establishing a connection. Do not share your access token.</p>
</div>
<div class="warning">

<p>These credentials give full access to your robot, including camera
stream, audio stream and data. Do not share these credentials.</p>
